  - sure, you can plan your day but
    - I also want to be able to say when I'm doing actual planning, i.e., creating a plan to do a specific task
    - planning can involve more than intention; it can involve actual preparation (making reservations), sequencing, delegation
    - ultimately, plan your day is colloquial
