Properties in RDF allow us to define or describe characteristics of resources.


## recommended format

- first line is a description of the predicate (the "tagline"), oriented towards explicating its usage in a "tool-tip" voice.
- maybe properties should be required to be (camel-case) compound terms, so you can always tell by looking they're not IRIs or (capitalized) classes
