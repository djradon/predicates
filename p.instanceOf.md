- [[p.alsoKnownAs]] isA, is a, is an instance of the class
- [[p.hasDomain]] [[c.Resource]]
- [[p.hasRange]] [[c.Class]]
- [[p.instanceOf]] [[c.Pred]] 
- [[p.equivalentPredicate]] [rdf:type](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type)

## instanceOf Discussion

- changed because 
  - "instanceOf" underscores that the subject is not a Class
  - it feels like, colloquially, "type" is ambiguous between hasType and isTypeOf; the latter can mean  something more like subClassOf
- isA is nice and compact, but maybe feels ambiguous for classes, e.g. "[a] digital garden is a website"
