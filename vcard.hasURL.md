# Has URL



- at it's weakest
  - paraphrase: "[[is-associated-with]] the URL"

## use of "URL"

### [[pred.vs]] URI

- [What's the Difference Between a URI and a URL?](https://danielmiessler.com/study/difference-between-uri-url/) :
  - "If the protocol (https, ftp, etc.) is either present or implied for a domain, you should call it a URL—even though it’s also a URI."

- the terms URI and IRI might represent more general and accessible concepts, but

## possible alternatives

## [[pred.vs]] [[foaf.homepage]]

"Has URL" is like `foaf.homepage`, but homepage (in the sense of a personal web site) feels almost aniquated. 

### "homepage" [[has-alternate-meaning]] 

- the "first page you go to on a site",
  - i.e. the high-effort page nobody sees any more
- the browser home page

##  [[pred.vs]] identifier

- [Data Model - schema.org](https://schema.org/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg)
  - "in most cases there is a conventional short name for most identifier schemes"
  - unrelated: "we do not treat isicV4 as a subproperty of identifier since it serves to identify a category not an individual Thing" -- categories need identifiers too!
