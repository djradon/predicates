## instanceOf Discussion

- changed because it feels like, colloquially, "type" is ambiguous between hasType and isTypeOf; the latter canmean  something more like subClassOf, e.g. Car is a type of Automobile, and not "my old mustange" is a type of Ford.
- isA is nice and compact, but maybe feels ambiguous for classes, e.g. "[a] digital garden is a website"
